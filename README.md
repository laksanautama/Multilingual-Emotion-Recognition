# Balinese Language Emotion Recognition -- (BaLER)
This repository contains experiments, code, and resources for emotion recognition in the Balinese language.
The project investigates several modelling strategies, ranging from classical multilingual language models to Large Language Models (LLMs) with different adaptation methods (Few-Shot, RAG, LoRA).
The main goal is to explore how modern representation and generative models perform on low-resource languages such as Balinese.

        "disgust, sadness. the query \"inget tiang teken solah tiange sane ten nawang tata krama, mawak luh tusing bisa makta raga\" (i remember my behavior that doesn't know manners, as a woman, i can't carry myself) expresses regret and self-reproach over one's own conduct. this aligns with the context examples:\n1. \"tiang marasa pelih pesan kanti nyuang somah timpal, nika mawinan tiang ten nyadia mamadu.\" (i feel very wrong even taking a friend's spouse, that's why i'm not ready to remarry.) which has the labels: disgust, sadness.\n2. \"bangayang pun tiang sane ngedenang pianak tiange padidi, mula saja tiang nenten mapineh nyemak solah sakadi puniki.\" (let me be the one who raises my child alone, indeed i did not intend to behave like this.) which also has the labels: disgust, sadness.\nboth examples involve a negative reflection on one's own actions or behavior, leading to feelings of disgust and sadness.",
        "anger, fear. the query contains the phrase \"dadi pamangku\", which is present in the context sentence \"nyanan pelengan makisid, awak suba dadi pamangku.\" this context sentence is explicitly labeled with \"anger, fear\".",
        "anger, sadness, surprise. the phrase \"jeg sajan tiang sing madaya\" directly indicates surprise, matching the context for \"surprise\". the phrase \"engsek asane keneh tiangge\" (my heart feels choked/distressed) conveys a strong feeling of emotional pain or distress, which aligns with the broader concept of sadness as seen in the context. the speaker's strong disapproval of the friends' actions (\"wih, da nake ketoanga, ia nak sing buduh, tambakin tiang lan kedeng tiang katelu timpal tiange ento\" - wow, don't treat her like that, she's not crazy, i stopped and pulled my three friends) and the defense of \"ia nak sing buduh\" (she's not crazy) directly relates to the \"anger\" context which describes \"anak buduh\" as those who harm and disturb others, implying the speaker's anger at the friends' behavior.",
        "no emotion. the context provides an example: \"meme sing sebet dugase tiang ngorahang dadi krama gsni. this text is contain emotion: no emotion\". the query contains a similar phrase \"meme sing cumpu\" in relation to \"dadi krama gsni\". based on the provided context, the mother's reaction concerning gsni membership is classified as \"no emotion\".",
        "anger, fear. the query describes pekak veteran \"ngamigmig\" (grumbling/complaining at length). this indicates a negative emotional state of displeasure or annoyance.\n1. the context provides an example \"inguh masih tiang ningehang\" (i'm still annoyed/bothered hearing it) which is labeled as \"fear\". this suggests that annoyance or being bothered can be mapped to \"fear\" within this specific context.\n2. grumbling is also a common manifestation of \"anger\" or frustration. the label \"anger\" is present in the context.\n3. the context demonstrates that multiple labels (e.g., \"anger, fear\") can be assigned to a single text, making it plausible to choose both for \"ngamigmig\" which can encompass aspects of both anger and fear (via annoyance)."

        "anger, sadness. the query \"mirib liu masih ada anak ane iri tur dengki kapining i buda.\" (perhaps there are still many people who are envious and resentful towards buda.) expresses a negative sentiment from others towards buda. this aligns closely with the context \"beh, mirib liu anake ane ngamadakang apang i buda enggal ngalain.\" (oh, perhaps many people wish buda would leave soon.), which is labeled with 'anger' and 'sadness'. the words \"iri tur dengki\" (envious and resentful) directly imply feelings of anger, and the observation of such widespread negative sentiment could evoke sadness in the speaker.",
        "sadness. the query contains the word \"lacur\" which is directly linked to \"sadness\" in the context example \"lacur idupne! this text is contain emotion: sadness\". the query is about helping an unfortunate (\"lacur\") person, which evokes a feeling of sadness for their situation.",
        "sadness. the query \"tiang suba med uli i pidan masomah teken bli\" expresses a strong negative sentiment of being \"fed up\" or \"tired\" of a long-term situation (marriage). this implies a deep weariness and despair. in the provided context, a similar strong negative sentiment, \"apang enggal bapa magedi uli dini\" (so that father quickly leaves from here), which also expresses a desire for a negative situation to end, is labeled as 'sadness'. following this precedent from the context, the feeling of being \"fed up\" with a marriage, implying a prolonged state of unhappiness and despair, aligns best with 'sadness'.",
        "no emotion. the query describes factual events and character traits of i arok (losing a fight, being a pickpocket, having debts). while these are negative, the text itself does not express an explicit emotional state of any character or the narrator. the provided context labels \"no emotion\" for descriptive and factual statements, even those concerning i arok's character or actions (e.g., \"yen dadi tulisang, meh bek kertase pragat adanne i arok dogen ngenah.\" and \"bibihne i arok mula mataksu...\"). the only example labeled \"fear\" explicitly mentions an emotional state (\"paling memenne\" - very worried/distressed mother), which is not present in the query. therefore, based solely on the provided examples, the query aligns best with \"no emotion.\"",
        "anger, disgust. the query describes a situation where a drunk person attempts to hug the speaker, who then dodges (\"tiang makelid\"). the speaker expresses a strong negative feeling by stating, \"jengah gati tiang.\" the act of dodging suggests an aversion to the interaction, which is consistent with **disgust** towards the inappropriate behavior or the person's state. furthermore, \"jengah\" in balinese often conveys feelings of annoyance, irritation, or being offended, which aligns well with **anger** at the inappropriate advance from the drunk individual.",
        "anger, fear, sadness, surprise. the phrase \"sing sida naanang sakit ati\" (couldn't bear the heartache/pain) is very similar to \"tan sida naanang sakit\" (couldn't bear the pain) in the context example \"neked delod dapetang bapan tiang sampun lemet tan sida naanang sakit,\" which is labeled with **fear, sadness, surprise**. additionally, the mother advising the father to \"suud ja nganten-palas, mamitra miwah mamotoh\" (stop marrying-divorcing, having affairs, and gambling) implies strong disapproval and frustration with his actions, which aligns with **anger** as seen in the context example \"suud matbat, memenne tundunga apang magedi jani ja\" (anger) and \"beh, mirib liu anake ane ngamadakang apang i buda enggal ngalain\" (anger, sadness) where negative actions lead to anger.",
        "no emotion. the query \"mirib saja satuan mekele luh dugase dibi puan, ada anak luh elenan ngoda keneh mekele lanang\" expresses suspicion about mekele lanang having another woman. this is directly comparable to the context example \"jani unduke ene patut slidikin, saja mirib mekele lanang ngelah anak luh len?\" which is explicitly labeled as \"no emotion\". the first part of the query \"lakar kija mirib mekele lanang?\" is a question of whereabouts, which in the context of the subsequent suspicion, does not carry the same exclamatory \"peh\" or intense observation that led to \"surprise\" in another example. therefore, based on the provided examples, the overall sentiment aligns with \"no emotion\".",
        "fear, sadness. the query \"uli sukat ento tusing pesan tiang bani tempal teken pangidih bapan tiange\" (since then, i really don't dare to defy my father's request) directly implies a feeling of being unable or unwilling to go against someone due to potential negative consequences or a strong sense of obligation. this aligns with the emotion of fear. the phrase \"tusing pesan tiang bani tempal\" (i really don't dare to defy) is a strong indicator of fear.\n\nthis situation is similar to the context example: \"baan bapan tiange dadi gunjing lantas mendep dogen. yen bani nglawan, patuh teken mati. this text is contain emotion: fear, sadness\". in this example, the inability to fight back due to severe consequences (death) is labeled with both fear and sadness. the query, while not mentioning death, describes a similar lack of agency in relation to a father's request, which can evoke both fear of repercussions and sadness over the lack of autonomy or the difficult situation.",
        "joy. the context associates the appearance of a \"joged\" (dancer) with the emotion \"joy\" (\"uli tengah rangkine saget pesu joged jegeg ngontel. this text is contain emotion: joy\"). the query describes the actions of \"jogede\" (the dancer), and since the context links \"joged\" to \"joy\", it is the most appropriate label to choose based *only* on the provided information.",
        "joy. the phrase \"adung-adungan\" implies harmony, compatibility, and getting along well in a relationship. this positive state is most closely associated with feelings of contentment and happiness, which aligns with the emotion of joy, similar to how \"kenyem-kenyem\" (smiling) indicates joy in the provided context. it describes a positive relational state, not a neutral one."
